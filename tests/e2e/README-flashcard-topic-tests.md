# Comprehensive E2E Tests for Flashcard-Topic Functionality

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) tests created for the topic-based flashcard functionality in the learning application. Two comprehensive test files have been created to verify the complete user workflow for topic-based flashcard management.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `flashcard-topic-functionality.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of all flashcard-topic interactions
**Coverage**: Complete user workflows from topic creation to flashcard management

### 2. `flashcard-topic-comprehensive.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Simplified, focused testing using proven patterns
**Coverage**: Core functionality with robust error handling

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Topic-Based Flashcard Creation Workflow
- ✅ Navigate to topic view and display flashcard section
- ✅ Create flashcard for specific topic
- ✅ Show topic information in flashcard creation context
- ✅ Verify topic-specific flashcard attribution

### Unit-Level Flashcard Management with Topic Grouping
- ✅ Display flashcards grouped by topic in unit view
- ✅ Show flashcard counts per topic in unit view
- ✅ Create flashcards from unit level with topic selection
- ✅ Navigate between unit and topic views seamlessly

### Flashcard Operations (Edit, Move, Delete)
- ✅ Edit topic-based flashcard content
- ✅ Move flashcard between topics
- ✅ Delete topic-based flashcard with confirmation
- ✅ Validate flashcard data based on card type

### Navigation and UI Elements
- ✅ Show flashcard counts in topic navigation
- ✅ Display proper breadcrumbs and context in topic flashcard views
- ✅ Show different flashcard types correctly in topic view
- ✅ Handle navigation between topics and units

### Form Validation and Error Handling
- ✅ Validate required fields in topic flashcard creation
- ✅ Handle network errors gracefully
- ✅ Show appropriate error messages
- ✅ Maintain form state during validation failures

### Access Control and Security
- ✅ Only show flashcards for authenticated user
- ✅ Hide management buttons in kids mode
- ✅ Verify proper authorization for topic-based operations
- ✅ Test different independence levels and permissions

## Key Test Features

### Database Models and Relationships
The tests verify the following database relationships:
- **Flashcard ↔ Topic**: `flashcard.topic_id` → `topics.id`
- **Topic ↔ Unit**: `topic.unit_id` → `units.id`
- **Unit ↔ Subject**: `unit.subject_id` → `subjects.id`
- **Subject ↔ User**: `subject.user_id` → `users.id`

### API Routes Tested
The tests cover both unit-scoped and topic-scoped routes:

**Unit-scoped Routes:**
- `GET /api/units/{unitId}/flashcards`
- `POST /api/units/{unitId}/flashcards`
- `PUT /api/units/{unitId}/flashcards/{flashcardId}`
- `DELETE /api/units/{unitId}/flashcards/{flashcardId}`

**Topic-scoped Routes:**
- `GET /api/topics/{topicId}/flashcards`
- `POST /api/topics/{topicId}/flashcards`
- `PUT /api/topics/{topicId}/flashcards/{flashcardId}`
- `DELETE /api/topics/{topicId}/flashcards/{flashcardId}`

### Flashcard Types Tested
- **Basic**: Question/Answer pairs
- **Multiple Choice**: Questions with multiple options
- **True/False**: Boolean questions
- **Cloze Deletion**: Fill-in-the-blank style

### Kids Mode Integration
- Verifies management buttons are hidden in kids mode
- Ensures content remains accessible to children
- Tests proper authorization flows

## Test Infrastructure

### Helper Classes Used
- **ModalHelper**: Handles modal interactions, HTMX loading, Alpine.js state
- **ElementHelper**: Safe element interactions with retries
- **KidsModeHelper**: Kids mode setup and teardown

### Test Data Setup
Each test creates:
1. **User Account**: Unique email per test run
2. **Child**: Required for subject creation
3. **Subject**: Container for learning materials
4. **Unit**: Container for topics
5. **Topics**: Containers for flashcards

### Robust Error Handling
- Multiple fallback approaches for UI interactions
- Graceful handling of timing issues
- Comprehensive debugging output
- Screenshot capture on failures

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Supabase is running locally
supabase start

# Verify PostgreSQL is available
supabase status
```

### Execute Tests
```bash
# Run all flashcard-topic tests
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "flashcard.*topic"

# Run specific test scenarios
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Topic-Based Flashcard Creation"
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Unit-Level Flashcard Management"

# Run with debugging output
npm run test:e2e:headed -- --grep "flashcard-topic"
```

### Test Configuration
- **Timeout**: 90 seconds per test (configurable)
- **Retries**: 2 automatic retries on failure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic reset between runs
- **Browser**: Chromium (configurable for other browsers)

## Implementation Details

### Topic-Based Flashcard Flow
1. **User navigates to topic page**
2. **Clicks "Add Flashcard" button**
3. **Fills flashcard form with topic context**
4. **Submits form via HTMX request**
5. **Backend assigns `topic_id` to flashcard**
6. **UI updates to show new flashcard in topic context**

### Unit-Level Topic Grouping
1. **User navigates to unit page**
2. **System displays flashcards grouped by topic**
3. **Shows count of flashcards per topic**
4. **Allows navigation to individual topics**
5. **Provides unit-level flashcard creation with topic selection**

### Controller Logic Tested
The FlashcardController handles both unit-based and topic-based requests:

```php
// Determine context from route
$isTopicBased = $topicId !== null || str_contains($request->route()->getName(), 'topics.flashcards');

// Set appropriate topic_id
if ($isTopicBased) {
    $validated['topic_id'] = $topic->id;
} else {
    $validated['topic_id'] = null; // Unit-level flashcard
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios
- **Bulk Operations**: Test bulk flashcard moves between topics
- **Import/Export**: Test CSV/JSON import with topic assignment
- **Performance**: Test large numbers of flashcards per topic
- **Mobile**: Test responsive design on mobile devices

### Advanced Features to Test
- **Topic Prerequisites**: Test prerequisite topic validation
- **Flashcard Scheduling**: Test spaced repetition per topic
- **Topic Completion**: Test topic completion tracking
- **Analytics**: Test topic-specific performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Child Selection**: Tests may fail if child dropdown is not properly handled
2. **Modal Timing**: HTMX + Alpine.js modals require proper wait strategies
3. **Database State**: Ensure test database is properly reset between runs

### Debugging Tips
```bash
# View test screenshots
ls test-results/*/test-failed-*.png

# Analyze trace files
npx playwright show-trace test-results/*/trace.zip

# Check test output logs
cat test-results/*/error-context.md
```

### Performance Considerations
- Tests use optimized wait strategies (reduced from 1000ms to 200ms where possible)
- Database operations are batched for efficiency
- Screenshots only captured on failures to reduce I/O

## Conclusion

These comprehensive E2E tests provide thorough coverage of the flashcard-topic functionality, ensuring that users can:
- Create topic-specific flashcards
- Manage flashcards at both unit and topic levels
- Navigate seamlessly between different views
- Access appropriate functionality based on their role (parent vs. child)
- Recover gracefully from errors and validation failures

The tests serve as both verification of current functionality and documentation of expected behavior for future development.
