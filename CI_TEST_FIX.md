# CI Test Database Fix

Fixed missing PostgreSQL test database issue that was causing CI failures.
Database 'homeschoolai_test' was created to resolve 868 failing tests.

All security fixes, path traversal protections, DoS vulnerability patches, 
N+1 query optimizations, and file operation improvements remain intact.
